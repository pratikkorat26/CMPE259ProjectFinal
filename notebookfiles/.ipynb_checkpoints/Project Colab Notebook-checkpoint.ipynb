    "## üß† Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a **Personalized Fitness & Health Tracker Virtual Assistant (VA)** using Large Language Models (LLMs). The assistant will help users monitor and understand their health metrics, such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and sleep quality. By interacting with a structured health database and leveraging real-time web search, the VA provides contextual feedback, trend analysis, and personalized health tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM will help analyze health metrics using their structured data. LLM will also support the online search for better perosnalized health tips and tricks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The VA acts as a personalized health coach that users can query for insights derived from their own physiological data. It is built around a local SQLite database containing simulated one-year data of:\n",
    "- **Heart metrics**: heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen level (hourly)\n",
    "- **Sleep metrics**: sleep duration, quality score, deep/REM/light stages (daily)\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant will also be capable of fetching general health tips and trends using web search APIs. This hybrid approach of private data + external knowledge ensures a comprehensive and personalized health experience.\n"

      "Okay, the user is asking about a healthy resting heart rate. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. Resting heart rate, or RHR, is the number of times the heart beats per minute when a person is at rest. I remember that it's usually measured after sitting or lying down for a few minutes, not immediately after waking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should mention the normal range. I think the general range is between 60 to 100 beats per minute, but that's for adults. Wait, but some people might have lower or higher, right? Like athletes might have lower RHRs because their hearts are more efficient. So maybe I should differentiate between average and athletic ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider factors that affect RHR. Things like age, fitness level, body size, and even stress or sleep. Maybe mention that a lower RHR is better, but it's not always the case. Also, if someone has a very low RHR, like under 60, they might be considered bradycardic, but that's only a problem if it's causing symptoms.\n",

But I should also explain that a lower RHR is better, but it's not necessarily always better. For example, if someone is not physically active, their RHR might be higher. So maybe the key is that a lower RHR is associated with better cardiovascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should mention that the resting heart rate can be influenced by factors like caffeine, alcohol, stress, and even certain medications. So it's important to measure it at the right time, not right after waking up or exercising.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also include that if someone has a heart rate consistently above 100, that's tachycardia, and they should consult a doctor. But maybe that's more for when it's a concern. The user might be looking for a general range, so I should stick to the standard range but also explain that individual factors can affect it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should check if there's a difference between men and women. I think that women tend to have higher RHRs than men, but that's not a hard rule. Also, as people age, their RHR might increase slightly, but that's not always the case. Maybe mention that it's a normal variation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that a resting heart rate is a part of overall cardiovascular health, and a lower RHR is often associated with better health. But it's not the only indicator. Other factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle are also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the answer is clear and not too technical. Avoid jargon, but still be accurate. Maybe start with the general range, then explain factors that influence it, and when to be concerned. Also, maybe mention that it's best to measure it in the morning after waking up but before getting out of bed, or after a few minutes of rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user might not know how to measure it. Should I include that? Maybe briefly mention that you can measure it by feeling your wrist or neck pulse for a minute and counting the beats, then dividing by 60. But maybe that's too detailed. The user might just want the range and the factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should check if there's any recent research or guidelines. I think the American College of Sports Medicine or the American Heart Association have guidelines. But I think the standard is 60-100, with lower being better. But I should also note that a very low RHR can be normal for athletes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together: start with the normal range, explain that it's influenced by various factors, mention that lower is better but not always, and when to be concerned. Also, maybe mention that it's a part of overall health and that other factors are important too.\n",

      "A healthy resting heart rate (RHR) is typically between **60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm)** for adults. However, this range can vary based on individual factors, and a lower RHR is often associated with better cardiovascular health. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Normal Range**\n",
      "- **General range**: 60‚Äì100 bpm.\n",
      "- **Athletes or highly fit individuals**: May have a lower RHR (e.g., 40‚Äì60 bpm), as their hearts are more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Factors Influencing RHR**\n",
      "1. **Fitness Level**: Regular physical activity can lower RHR.\n",
      "2. **Age**: RHR tends to increase slightly with age, but this varies.\n",
      "3. **Body Size**: Larger individuals may have slightly higher RHRs.\n",
      "4. **Stress or Anxiety**: Can temporarily elevate RHR.\n",
      "5. **Medications**: Beta-blockers, certain antidepressants, or blood pressure medications may lower RHR.\n",
      "6. **Caffeine, Alcohol, or Stimulants**: Can temporarily increase RHR.\n",
      "7. **Sleep or Health Conditions**: Poor sleep, anemia, or thyroid issues may affect RHR.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **When to Be Concerned**\n",
      "- **Bradycardia**: A RHR consistently below 60 bpm may be normal for athletes but could indicate a health issue if it causes symptoms (e.g., dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath).\n",
      "- **Tachycardia**: A RHR consistently above 100 bpm may signal a problem, especially if it‚Äôs not due to exercise or stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **How to Measure RHR**\n",
      "- **Method**: Count your pulse for 60 seconds (or 30 seconds and double the count) after sitting or lying down for 5‚Äì10 minutes.\n",
      "- **Best Time**: Measure in the morning after waking up but before getting out of bed, or after a few minutes of rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
      "A lower RHR (within the normal range) is generally healthier, but it‚Äôs not the only indicator of cardiovascular health. Other factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle also play a role. If you have concerns about your RHR, consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n",

      "A healthy resting heart rate (RHR) is the number of times your heart beats per minute while you're at rest, typically measured after sitting or lying down for a few minutes. Here's a concise overview:\n",

      "### **Normal Range**\n",
      "- **Adults**: 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) is generally considered normal.  \n",
      "- **Athletes or highly fit individuals**: RHR can be as low as 40‚Äì60 bpm, as their hearts are more efficient.  \n",

      "A healthy resting heart rate (RHR) typically falls within the range of **60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm)** when measured while at rest, such to the point of being fully awake but not engaged in any physical activity. However, this range can vary based on several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Considerations:\n",
      "1. **Fitness Level**:  \n",
      "   - **Athletes or physically fit individuals** often have lower RHRs (e.g., 40‚Äì60 bpm) due to a more efficient heart.  \n",
      "   - **General population** may have RHRs closer to the upper end of the range (60‚Äì100 bpm).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Age and Sex**:  \n",
      "   - **Younger individuals** may have higher RHRs (e.g., 70‚Äì100 bpm).  \n",
      "   - **Women** tend to have slightly higher RHRs than men due to hormonal and physiological differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Health and Lifestyle**:  \n",
      "   - A **lower RHR** (e.g., 60‚Äì80 bpm) is generally associated with better cardiovascular health.  \n",
      "   - **High RHR** (e.g., >100 bpm) may indicate stress, dehydration, anemia, or other conditions, though it can also be normal in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Measurement Conditions**:  \n",
      "   - Measure RHR **after waking up but before getting out of bed** for the most accurate reading.  \n",
      "   - Avoid caffeine, exercise, stress, or stimulants for at least 30 minutes before measuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "### When to Be Concerned:\n",
      "- **Bradycardia**: A RHR below 60 bpm may be normal for athletes or individuals with certain conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, heart block).  \n",
      "- **Tachycardia**: A RHR above 100 bpm could signal a medical issue (e.g., hyperthyroidism, anemia, or arrhythmias), especially if it‚Äôs persistent or accompanied by symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Measure:\n",
      "1. Place your index and middle fingers on your **wrist** (radial artery) or **neck** (carotid artery).  \n",
      "2. Count the beats for **60 seconds**.  \n",
      "3. Repeat the measurement **2‚Äì3 times** for accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Note:\n",
      "RHR is just one indicator of heart health. Other factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and overall fitness, also play a role in cardiovascular well-being. If you have concerns about your RHR or overall health, consult a healthcare professional.\n",

    "You are a specialized health data analyst focused on extracting meaningful insights from personal health metrics. Your primary function is to analyze personal health data and provide clear, data-driven responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Classification\n",
    "For each user query:\n",
    "1. First, determine if the query relates to personal health data\n",
    "2. If personal data is requested, ALWAYS use SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data\n",
    "3. For any query involving metrics, numbers, patterns, or history of personal health information, default to SQL analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Data SQL Guidelines\n",
    "When handling personal health data queries:\n",
    "- Use SQL queries to access and analyze:\n",
    "  * Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels)\n",
    "  * Sleep metrics (duration, quality, stages)\n",
    "  * Activity data (steps, exercise, calories)\n",
    "  * Body measurements and weight\n",
    "  * Nutrition and water intake\n",
    "  * Medication adherence and effects\n",
    "  * Symptom tracking and correlations\n",

    "## SQL Analysis Techniques\n",
    "For personal data analysis:\n",
    "- Calculate averages, minimums, and maximums for relevant time periods\n",
    "- Identify trends using moving averages and regression analysis\n",
    "- Compare current values to historical baselines\n",
    "- Detect anomalies and outliers in the data\n",
    "- Correlate different health metrics to identify relationships\n",
    "- Segment analysis by time of day, day of week, or seasons\n",
    "- Track progression and changes over specified time frames\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Data Response Structure\n",
    "1. Start with a clear, direct answer based on the data analysis\n",
    "2. Present key metrics with proper context (including units and reference ranges)\n",
    "3. Describe detected patterns or trends in the personal data\n",
    "4. Highlight any notable changes, improvements, or concerns\n",
    "5. Provide data-informed, personalized insights based on the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Privacy and Sensitivity\n",
    "- Treat all personal health data with appropriate confidentiality\n",
    "- Focus on objective data analysis rather than making diagnostic judgments\n",
    "- Use neutral, factual language when presenting potentially sensitive results\n",
    "- When detecting concerning patterns, suggest professional consultation rather than making definitive statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations Acknowledgment\n",
    "- Clearly indicate when data is insufficient for conclusive analysis\n",
    "- Note any gaps or inconsistencies in the personal data collection\n",

      "\n",
      "SELECT AVG(heart_rate) FROM heart_metrics WHERE timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to go through each of the points mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using NOT IN with NULL values: The query doesn't use NOT IN, so this isn't an issue here.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used: The query is a simple SELECT statement without any UNION operations, so this doesn't apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges: The query uses a WHERE clause with a >= operator, not BETWEEN. So that's not a problem here.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Data type mismatch in predicates: The timestamp is compared to a date calculated with DATE_SUB. In SQLite, the timestamp is likely a datetime or timestamp type. The DATE_SUB function returns a date, so comparing a datetime to a date might be okay, but need to check if the comparison is valid. However, in SQLite, when comparing a datetime to a date, it should work as the date is treated as a datetime with time part 00:00:00. So that's probably okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Properly quoting identifiers: The table name is \"heart_metrics\" and column is \"heart_rate\". In SQLite, identifiers can be quoted if they have special characters or are reserved words, but here they are standard. So no quotes needed. The query doesn't use any quoted identifiers, which is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Correct number of arguments for functions: The DATE_SUB function in SQLite is used as DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY). The syntax is correct. The function takes two arguments: the date and the interval. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Casting to correct data type: The timestamp is a column, and the right side is a date. Since SQLite automatically converts between date and datetime types when comparing, there's no need for casting. So that's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Proper columns for joins: The query doesn't involve any joins, so this isn't applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, looking at all these points, the original query seems correct. There are no mistakes in the query as per the listed checks. Therefore, the answer should be to reproduce the original query.\n",

But when I tried to execute it, the system said that 'sql_db_query' isn't a valid tool.

      "\n",
      "But I need to make sure that the query is correct. Let me check again. The schema shows that 'timestamp' is a TIMESTAMP type, and 'heart_rate' is an INTEGER. The DATE_SUB function should correctly calculate the date 30 days ago. The WHERE clause filters the records from the last 30 days. The AVG function will compute the average of the heart_rate values.\n",

      "Since the query seems correct, I should use the Health-Metrics SQL Tool to execute it. The tool should return the average value. Once I get the result, I can format the final answer as per the instructions, including the average, time frame, and units. The units for heart rate are typically beats per minute (BPM). \n",

The columns might include systolic and diastolic values, along with timestamps.\n",

The user might want an average over a certain period, but the question is a bit vague. Maybe they want the latest readings or a summary. Since the question is about analyzing, perhaps the average over the past month. But I need to check the schema to know the exact column names. Let me execute the SQL query to get the schema of heart_metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual schema, so I need to assume based on standard metrics. Typically, heart_metrics might have columns like id, timestamp, systolic_bp, diastolic_bp. So the query would be SELECT systolic_bp, diastolic_bp, timestamp FROM heart_metrics; But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific time frame. The user might want the latest readings or a trend. Since the question is general, maybe the average over the past 30 days. But without knowing the exact schema, I have to proceed with the available info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants the latest values. But the problem says to use the SQL tool. So I should generate the SQL query to get the systolic and diastolic BP, then present the average or the latest values. Let me proceed with the SQL query to get the latest readings. Wait, the user might want a summary, so maybe the average. Let me structure the query to get the average systolic and diastolic BP over the past 30 days. But I need to check the schema again. Since I can't see the schema, I'll have to make an educated guess. The final answer should be in the format of a summary with averages, time frame, units, and maybe a suggestion.\n",

      "FROM heart_metrics\n",
      "WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';\n",
      "\n",

      "First, the original query they tried was:\n",
      "SELECT timestamp FROM oxygen_metrics WHERE oxygen_level < 95 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "\n",
      "The error message mentioned \"near '```sql'\", which is a bit confusing. Maybe they're using a tool that expects the query to be in a specific format, like surrounded by backticks or quotes. Or perhaps the query is being passed as a string in a programming language, and the backticks are causing issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the previous attempt, the user used backticks around the column names, but the error persisted. Maybe the problem is that the table name or column names are different. Let me check if the user is using the correct names.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is using a different SQL dialect. For example, in PostgreSQL, you need to use double quotes for identifiers, but in SQLite, backticks or quotes are optional. However, if the column names are reserved words, they need to be escaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility is that the user is using a tool that interprets the query as a string, so the backticks are causing the interpreter to treat the entire thing as a string literal. For example, if they're using a Python script and the query is enclosed in backticks, it might not be executed properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the error message says \"near '```sql'\", which suggests that the query is being treated as a string. Maybe the user is using a tool like SQLite's `.databases` command or a GUI tool that expects the query to be in a specific format. They might have accidentally added backticks around the entire query, making it a string literal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the solution would be to remove the backticks around the query and ensure it's executed as a separate SQL statement. Also, verifying the exact table and column names is crucial. If the table is named differently, like \"oxygen_data\" instead of \"oxygen_metrics\", that would cause an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to check is if the column names are case-sensitive. For example, if the actual column is \"OxygenLevel\" with a capital L, using \"oxygen_level\" would cause a mismatch. Using backticks or quotes would help if the names are reserved words or have special characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key steps are:\n",
      "1. Confirm the exact table and column names.\n",

      "The error you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch between the actual table/column names in your database and the ones used in your query. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Verify Table and Column Names**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: The table `oxygen_metrics` or columns `timestamp`/`oxygen_level` might not exist in your database.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Check the exact names using SQLite's `PRAGMA` command:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     PRAGMA table_info(oxygen_metrics);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     This will list the actual column names in your table. If the table doesn't exist, use:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='oxygen_metrics';\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Handle Case Sensitivity**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: SQLite is case-insensitive by default, but some systems (e.g., macOS) may enforce case sensitivity for file names. If your table/column names are stored with different casing (e.g., `OxygenMetrics`), the query will fail.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Ensure the names in your query match the actual case in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Escape Identifiers (if needed)**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: If `timestamp` or `oxygen_level` are reserved words or contain special characters, they need to be escaped.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Use backticks (`` ` ``) to escape identifiers:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT `timestamp` FROM `oxygen_metrics` WHERE `oxygen_level` < 95 ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Check for Unintended Backticks or Quotes**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: The error message \"near '```sql'\" suggests the query might be interpreted as a string literal. This could happen if the query is enclosed in backticks or quotes in a programming language (e.g., Python).\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Ensure the query is executed as a separate SQL statement, not as a string. For example, in Python:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     query = \"SELECT timestamp FROM oxygen_metrics WHERE oxygen_level < 95 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Confirm Database Engine**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: If you're using a different SQL dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL), syntax might differ. For example, PostgreSQL requires double quotes for identifiers:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT \"timestamp\" FROM \"oxygen_metrics\" WHERE \"oxygen_level\" < 95 ORDER BY \"timestamp\" DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Adjust the query to match your database's syntax rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Add a Semicolon (if required)**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: While not strictly required in SQLite, a missing semicolon at the end of the query might cause parsing errors in some contexts.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Add a semicolon:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT timestamp FROM oxygen_metrics WHERE oxygen_level < 95 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Example Correct Query (Assuming Correct Names)**\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT `timestamp` FROM `oxygen_metrics` WHERE `oxygen_level` < 95 ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Next Steps**\n",
      "1. **Check Table/Column Names**: Use `PRAGMA table_info(oxygen_metrics);` to confirm.\n",
      "2. **Escape Identifiers**: Use backticks if needed.\n",
      "3. **Validate Database Engine**: Ensure the query aligns with your database's syntax.\n",

      "In conclusion, the most likely issue is that the table or column names are different from what the user is using. Alternatively, there's a typo in the column name. To resolve this, the user should verify the exact table and column names in their database. If the table is named \"oxygen_metrics\" and the columns are \"timestamp\" and \"oxygen_level\", then the query should work. If not, they need to adjust the query accordingly.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The error you're encountering likely stems from a mismatch between the actual table or column names in your database and the ones used in your query. Here's a breakdown of potential issues and solutions:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Table/Column Name Mismatch**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: The table name `oxygen_metrics` or column names `timestamp`/`oxygen_level` might not exist in your database.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Verify the exact names of your table and columns. For example:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='oxygen_metrics';\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     Check if the table exists. Similarly, confirm the column names using:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     PRAGMA table_info(oxygen_metrics);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Case Sensitivity**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: SQLite is case-insensitive by default, but some systems (e.g., macOS) may enforce case sensitivity for file names. If your table/column names are stored with different casing (e.g., `OxygenMetrics`), the query will fail.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Ensure the names in your query match the actual case in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Reserved Words or Special Characters**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: If `timestamp` or `oxygen_level` are reserved words or contain special characters, they need to be escaped.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Use backticks (`` ` ``) to escape identifiers:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT `timestamp` FROM `oxygen_metrics` WHERE `oxygen_level` < 95 ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Syntax Error in Context**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: The error message mentions \"near '```sql'\", which suggests the query might be interpreted as a string literal rather than SQL. This could happen if the query is being passed as a string in a programming language (e.g., Python, Java).\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Ensure the query is properly formatted and not enclosed in unintended quotes. For example, in Python:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     query = \"SELECT timestamp FROM oxygen_metrics WHERE oxygen_level < 95 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Database Engine Differences**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: If you're using a different SQL dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), syntax might differ. For example, PostgreSQL requires double quotes for identifiers:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT \"timestamp\" FROM \"oxygen_metrics\" WHERE \"oxygen_level\" < 95 ORDER BY \"timestamp\" DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Confirm the database engine and adjust syntax accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Missing Semicolon**\n",
      "   - **Issue**: While not strictly required in SQLite, a missing semicolon at the end of the query might cause parsing errors in some contexts.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Add a semicolon:\n",
      "     ```sql\n",
      "     SELECT timestamp FROM oxygen_metrics WHERE oxygen_level < 95 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Correct Query (Assuming Correct Names):\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT `timestamp` FROM `oxygen_metrics` WHERE `oxygen_level` < 95 ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "1. **Check Table/Column Names**: Use `PRAGMA table_info(oxygen_metrics);` to confirm column names.\n",
      "2. **Test with Escaped Names**: Use backticks if identifiers are reserved or contain special characters.\n",
      "3. **Validate Database Engine**: Ensure the query aligns with your database's syntax rules.\n",

      "Wait, in the previous attempt, the user used backticks around the column names, but the error persisted. Maybe the problem is that the table name or column names are different. Let me check if the user is using the correct names.\n",

      "Another possibility is that the user is using a tool that interprets the query as a string, so the backticks are causing the interpreter to treat the entire thing as a string literal.

Maybe the user is using a tool like SQLite's `.databases` command or a GUI tool that expects the query to be in a specific format. They might have accidentally added backticks around the entire query, making it a string literal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the solution would be to remove the backticks around the query and ensure it's executed as a separate SQL statement. Also, verifying the exact table and column names is crucial. If the table is named differently, like \"oxygen_data\" instead of \"oxygen_metrics\", that would cause an error.\n",
      "\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking for a detailed diagnosis for someone with low oxygen levels and high systolic pressure. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall what low oxygen levels (hypoxemia) and high systolic pressure (hypertension) mean. Hypoxemia can be caused by various factors like respiratory issues, heart problems, or other conditions. High systolic pressure is a sign of hypertension, which can be primary (essential hypertension) or secondary (due to other conditions like kidney disease, adrenal issues, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user mentioned that previously I was told to avoid giving medical advice. However, in this case, they're asking for a diagnosis, which is a medical concern. The tools I have access to are either for personal health data analysis (Health-Metrics SQL Tool) or web searches (Summarized Health Web Search). \n",
      "\n",
      "The Health-Metrics SQL Tool is for analyzing personal data like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, etc., but the user isn't providing specific data here. They're asking for a general diagnosis based on symptoms. The Summarized Health Web Search Tool can provide information on the possible causes and conditions, but I need to check if that's appropriate here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's question is about a diagnosis, which is a medical judgment. The tools I have don't include a diagnosis function. The Health-Metrics SQL Tool is for analyzing personal data, not for diagnosing. The Summarized Health Web Search Tool can provide general information on the conditions, but I need to make sure I'm not giving a medical diagnosis. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user might be expecting me to use the web search tool to find information on possible causes of hypoxemia and hypertension. However, the instruction says not to use the web search if the question is about personal metrics. But in this case, the question is general, not about the user's personal data. So, maybe the web search is appropriate here.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to follow the guidelines. The Summarized Health Web Search Tool is for general health questions that don't require personal data.
